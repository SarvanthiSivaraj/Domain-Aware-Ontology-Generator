# Domain-Aware-Ontology-Generator
Ontology engineering plays a critical role in knowledge representation and semantic data integration, particularly in domains such as cybersecurity where large volumes of structured data must be interpreted efficiently. However, traditional ontology development is largely manual, time-consuming, and requires significant domain expertise. This project proposes a Domain-Aware OWL Ontology Generation Framework that automates the transformation of structured cybersecurity data into machine-readable ontologies.

The system employs a semi-automatic approach to analyze structured datasets such as JSON and CSV files, extract domain entities, identify attributes, and detect relationships using rule-based techniques. By incorporating domain awareness, the framework improves the accuracy of ontology construction while significantly reducing human intervention. The generated OWL files are compatible with standard semantic web tools, enabling efficient knowledge representation, reasoning, and data interoperability.

This framework aims to simplify ontology engineering by providing a lightweight, scalable, and extensible solution for automated ontology generation. Additionally, the proposed system establishes a foundation that can be extended to support multiple domains and enhanced with intelligent techniques such as machine learning for advanced relationship prediction. The expected outcome is a functional ontology generator that accelerates semantic modeling and supports improved cybersecurity data analysis.
