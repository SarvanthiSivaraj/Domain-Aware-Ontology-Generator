# Domain-Aware-Ontology-Generator
Ontology engineering is fundamental to knowledge representation and semantic data integration, especially in cybersecurity, where large volumes of structured data must be interpreted efficiently. Traditional ontology development is largely manual, time-consuming, and dependent on domain expertise, creating a need for more automated solutions.

This project proposes a Domain-Aware OWL Ontology Generation Framework that automates the transformation of structured cybersecurity datasets into machine-readable ontologies. The system adopts a semi-automatic approach to analyze data formats such as JSON and CSV, perform schema extraction, identify domain entities, classify attributes, and detect relationships using rule-based semantic techniques.

By incorporating domain awareness, the framework enhances the accuracy and consistency of ontology construction while significantly reducing human intervention. The generated OWL files are compatible with standard semantic web tools, supporting efficient knowledge representation, reasoning, and interoperability across systems.

The proposed framework is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and extensible, enabling future enhancements such as multi-domain support and intelligent relationship prediction. Ultimately, the system aims to simplify ontology engineering, accelerate semantic modeling, and improve the analysis of cybersecurity data.
